## Description

This script removes defined files from targeted folders. It is meant to be used by System Administrators, because it has many options and settings that can be configured to remove files in multiple and various ways. All data regarding file removal, target folders, file names, optional number of days files must be older then to be removed, if files in subfolders should be removed, and if files should be force removed, are written by user in [`Data.csv`](https://github.com/Zoran-Jankov/File-Removal-PowerShell-Script/blob/master/Data.csv) file. User can enter partial names of files in `FileName` column with a wildcard character, for example `*.dat` or `Backup*`. Script generates detailed log file, and report that is sent via email. In [`Settings.cfg`](https://github.com/Zoran-Jankov/File-Removal-PowerShell-Script/blob/master/Settings.cfg) file parameters are stored for email settings, and options to turn on or off console writing, loging, and email report as the user requires them.

#### Data parameters

|FolderPath|FileName|OlderThen|Recurse|Force|
|----------|:------:|--------:|------:|----:|

-   **`FolderPath`** - In this column write the full path of the folder in which files are to be removed.
    -   ***Example:*** *C:\Folder\Folder\Folder*

-   **`FileName`** - In this column write the name of the file which is to be removed. It can include a wild card character **`*`** so multiple files can be affected.
    -   ***Example:*** * (Remove all files in target folder)
    -   ***Example:*** *Cache.bat* (Remove only the file named "Cache.bat")
    -   ***Example:*** **.bmp* (Remove all files with ".bmp" extension)
    -   ***Example:*** *Backup** (Remove all files with name starting with "Backup")

-   **`OlderThen`** - In this column write the number of days to remove files older than that in integer format
    -   ***Example:*** *180* (Remove all files older than six months)
    -   ***Example:*** *0* (Remove all files regardless of file creation time)

-   **`Recurse`** - In this column enter ***true*** if file removal in subfolders is required.
    -   ***Example:*** *true* (Remove all files even in subfolders of the target folder)
    -   ***Example:*** *false* (No files in subfolders of the target folder will be removed)

-   **`Force`** - In this column enter ***true*** if force removal of files is required.
    -   ***Example:*** *true* (Force remove all selected files)
    -   ***Example:*** *false* (Selected files will not be removed by force)

All of the data parameters are taken in account while script is calculating which files will be removed. This is very convenient because it is possible to target multiple folders with different rulers for file removal with a single script.
